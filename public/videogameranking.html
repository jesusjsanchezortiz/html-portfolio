 <h1>Jesse's Favorite Video Games</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 video games of all time!</h2>
 <hr>
 <h3>Legends of Runeterra</h3>
 <p>This card game is my favorite because
    the game is beuatifully designed. The game
    is  always  balanced and allows for player-interaction
    unseen in other card games.</p>
 <h3>Brawl Stars</h3>
 <p>This game is just fun because it's simple.
    It's just a bunch of characters each
    with their own attacks and abilities brawling
    it out in various game modes.</p>
 <h3>Pac-Man 256</h3>
 <p>It's classic pac-man with a twist! You can 
    unlock unique abilities to destroy ghosts!
    Or like in one of my favorite abilities,
    sneak past them!</p>
