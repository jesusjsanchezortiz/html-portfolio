<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Since high school, I've been interested in programming. I was
  in a video game design program in high school. Then I studied a bit
  of computer science as I got my associate's degree. I then decided
  to self-teach myself everything I needed to know about full-stack
  web development. And now I am hoping to help other with their websites
  needs as a freelancer.
